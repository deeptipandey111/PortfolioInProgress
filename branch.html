As I navigated between different apps, I started to notice the fine tunings in the context of deeplinking. I would work with the client teams to in turn understand the user needs. During this process, I noticed the fine details when it comes to functionality, and how it can affect user experience irrespective of the visual design. The UX learnings from Branch stayed with me even when I left Branch to pursue my Masters degree and documented <a href=”https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ignoring-web-to-app-connectivity-could-grave-ux-error-deepti-pandey/”>my take on Amazon Prime Video as a user experience</a></p>

As I worked with these clients, I got a deep understanding into the dynamics of a company vary over their demographics and keeping that in mind, I was able to confer the niche solutions that they were interested in. As I met with my clients regularly, and kept track of the progress they were making, I slowly started to create my own ways to make the integrations seamless and time efficient.</p>

                            Working at Branch was an enriching experience where I spent my thinking about creative ideas on application growth from a design perspective and I served as a great foundation for my problem solving skills. It solidified my love for building products that move towards stellar growth.
