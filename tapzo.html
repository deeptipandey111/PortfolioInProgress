                <p class="text-justify">I contributed to the  excellent UI/UX of Tapzo iOS app(now acquired by Amazon) as a Front-End Engineer and independently developed over 75% of the last live app using Swift coupled with Core Data, Core Animation and Apple Notifications. I performed Unit Testing and App Distribution(to the App Store). My experience at Tapzo, which is a horizontal platform product, has profusely enhanced my thought process, in terms of not only customer satisfaction but also product stability.</p>

                        <p class="text-justify">I joined Tapzo fresh out of college in June, 2016, really excited to be a mobile app developer. On week 1, we were all assigned the task of improving the existing cab ride feature on the app. This had various features, such as improving the backend, the Android app experience, the iOS app experience or perform data analysis towards the accuracy of location points. When in college, I had worked on building web applications and some Android mobile applications, and I wanted to learn more, so I picked the task of improving on the iOS app. As I worked toward improving the cab experience on the iOS app, I started noticing the large difference that a professional app used by millions of users had as opposed to anything I had learnt from class or online tutorials. This was first real world experience into how different it was to get scores in class assignments where the minimum expectations were set, to an actual live products used by actual users where there were no minimum expectations at all! By the end of the week I did improve the accuracy of the mobile app, but was still lacking in a visual design sense and I realised that this is something that I would like to work towards. </p>
